Line:

Used an Array, a linear, ordered arrangement of elements and suggested by initialize method of the exercise code

1) a) joining the line means to simply append the new member to the array
   b) searching for a particular member requires iterating through each element until a match is found
   c) removing a particular member, requires first searching (see above) and then setting element to be empty or nil (though probably should just remove the element to shorten the line
   d) searching for which member is in a particular position (e.g., front) in the line merely requires accessing the element in that position
2) see 1b
3) a stack of papers, cars on a metered on-ramp waiting to enter freeway traffic




Pixel:

Used an Array of Arrays to act as a two-dimensional array (or matrix)

1) a) inserting a pixel can be done directly to the Array of Arrays by simply referring to their position in the arrays using x and y
   b) searching for a pixel by x and y position is done by simply accessing the same element indices within the two-dimensional array
   c) removing a particular pixel can be done by reseting the element at its position with nil
2) see 1b
3) a grid based map (i.e., discrete coordinates, not continuous), seats in an auditorium
