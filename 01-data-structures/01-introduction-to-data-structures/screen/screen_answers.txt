Used an Array of Arrays to act as a two-dimensional array (or matrix)

1) a) inserting a pixel can be done directly to the Array of Arrays by simply referring to their position in the arrays using x and y
   b) searching for a pixel by x and y position is done by simply accessing the same element indices within the two-dimensional array
   c) removing a particular pixel can be done by reseting the element at its position with nil
2) see 1b
3) a grid based map (i.e., discrete coordinates, not continuous), seats in an auditorium
